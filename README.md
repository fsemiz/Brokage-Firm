## Notes
- Orders will not be matched against each other but will be processed sequentially by an admin.
- A customer table is added and if they are admin they have the ability the match the orders. Otherwise they can see their own assets and orders.
- All orders are initially added PENDING and usableSizes are reduced from TRY for further orders.
- Sizes and usable sizes are updated when the order is matched or cancelled.
- TRY usable sizes are updated by the asset size * price (total cost).
- The system tracks both `size` and `usableSize` for each asset, ensuring correct balance management.
- Spring security default username password are admin and admin respectively
